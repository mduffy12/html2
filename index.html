		<h3>This is <b>Barkley</b></h3>
		<p>Barkley is one of my best friends. He is a seven year old <b><i>Husky-Shepherd</i></b> mix. My mom found him sitting at our front door one morning. He was abandoned in the neighborhood and we adopted him.  He was only a year old when we found him. Mom calls him a big teddy bear because he weighs almost <b>100 lbs</b> and is very lovable.</p> 
		<h2 style="color:royalblue">Gabby</h2>

		<h3>This is <b>Gabby,</b></h3>
		<p>Gabby is another one of my best friends.  She is a one year old <b><i>Belgian Malinois.</i></b> She is full of energy and loves to run and play with her ball. We adopted her when she was only four months old. Being a puppy she would love to chew on my mom's throw rugs, which would make my mom very upset. But we love her anyway.</p>
		<h2 style="color:royalblue">Mojo</h2>

		<p> Mojo is my little baby. She is a 14 year old <b><i>Jack Russell Terrier.</i></b> She likes to hangout in the backyard of my Dad's house and wait for the raccoons and possums to come out so she can chase them. Mojo was my first dog.</p>
