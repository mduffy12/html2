		<p>Barkley is one of my best friends. He is a seven year old <b><i>Husky-Shepherd</i></b> mix. My mom found him sitting at our front door one morning. He was abandoned in the neighborhood and we adopted him.  He was only a year old when we found him. Mom calls him a big teddy bear because he weighs almost <b>100 lbs</b> and is very lovable.</p>

		<h3>This is <b>Gabby,</b></h3>
	</div>
		<p>Gabby is another one of my best friends.  She is a one year old <b><i>Belgian Malinois.</i></b> She is full of energy and loves to run and play with her ball. We adopted her when she was only four months old. Being a puppy she would love to chew on my mom's throw rugs, which would make my mom very upset. But we love her anyway.</p>
